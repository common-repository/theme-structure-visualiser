Helps visualise the template structure of a theme

== Description ==
*Theme Structure Visualiser* displays the path to a template file or template part just above the part of the layout generated by the template file or template part.

It can be extremely useful to quickly visualise and understand how a given theme\'s template structure works, especially for unfamiliar themes.

It helps correlate the template files in the theme\'s code and the part of the layout that it generates for a theme developer.

Intended for use in learning and development, it can be useful to those learning how to develop themes or extend themes using child themes. It has no use or place and hence, is **not recommended for production sites**. 

== Installation ==
 * Install the plugin from the ‘Plugins’ section in your dashboard (Go to Plugins > Add New > Search and search for Template Structure Visualiser for WordPress).
 * Alternatively, you can download the plugin from the repository. Unzip it and upload it to the plugins folder of your WordPress installation (wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation).
